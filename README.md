# hello-world
 Or maybe I should say "Hello To The NEW TO ME World
. I habe been living in active addiction for most of my life. I always wanted to live a healthy and happy life but I didn't know how to change and I had pretty much just gotten resigned to the fact that I would never have the life I desperately wanted to live. With that loss of Hope and Faith I saw no reason to continue living and breathing in a world that I felt I didn't deserve to live in. I hit bottom and then I found a strength that I never knew existed. I have been sober now since September 11, 2018
